# **Grafcet**

Grafcet, which stands for "Graphe Fonctionnel de Commande Etape Transition" in French, translates to "Functional Graph of Control Stage Transition." Essentially, it is a graphical representation model of the successive behaviors of a logical system, predefined by its inputs and outputs. It is also a graph or normalized functional diagram that allows modeling of the process to be automated, considering inputs, actions to be performed, and the intermediate processes that trigger these actions. Initially, it was proposed to document the sequential stage of discrete event process control systems.

It was not conceived as a programming language for automata but rather as a type of graph to create a model with the direct execution of automation or automaton programs. Several manufacturers in their high-end automata allow this direct step, making it a powerful graphical programming language for automata adapted to solving sequential systems. Currently, it does not have widespread use as a language because most automata cannot be programmed directly in this language, unlike the Ladder language. However, it has become universal as a modeling tool that allows for a direct transition to programming, also with Ladder.

**Initial Specifications**

A pneumatic sequence A+B+A-B- will be carried out, controlled by a PLC programmed in ladder logic, which extracts its instructions through the use of the Grafcet (Graph of Functional Control with Stages and Transitions) diagram proposed below:

**Ladder Logic PLC Programming**

Taking into account the aforementioned specifications (Grafcet, Inputs, and Outputs), the ladder logic code is implemented for the PLC to perform the control role in carrying out the process. Two circuits are proposed, one where the established sequence is executed and can be stopped at any time, and another with safety measures, so that the cylinders return to their initial state at any stop point.

**Exercise A – Sequence A+B+A-B-**

**Simulation**
The circuit starts with the A0 and B0 sensors activated, after which the A+B+A-B- sequence begins.

Reset or otherwise the proposed system sensor causes the sequence to repeat itself. As long as the system is starting up

The circuit starts with sensors A0 and B0 activated, and after the start, the A+B+A-B- sequence begins. The Reset or, in its absence, the sensor of the proposed system causes the sequence to repeat as long as the system is in the "Start" state.

**Exercise B – Safety during Stop plus Sequence / Extra Program and Simulation**

Unlike exercise A, when executing an Emergency Stop or a Reset; the cylinders return to their initial state.
As shown in the simulation, the solenoid valves that cause the cylinders to retract (Y2 and Y4 respectively for A and B) are activated. This causes them to be retracted.

**Conclusion**

I understood how Grafcet works for the development of an electro-pneumatic circuit through simulation and commissioning of the proposed sequence problem. I observed the basic elements, characteristics, and preliminary principles for the creation and implementation of a control diagram with stages and transitions that control a multidisciplinary system.
