## Practice Number 8: Counters

### Count Up Counter (CTU)
The Count Up (CTU) instruction counts forward from the current value each time the Count Up (CU) input transitions from off to on. When the current value Cxx is greater than or equal to the preset value PV, the Cxx counter bit turns on. The counter resets to zero when the Reset (R) input is turned on or when the Reset instruction is executed. The counter stops counting when it reaches the maximum value (32,767).

**STL Operation:**
- Reset Input: Top of the stack.
- Count Up Input: Value loaded in the second stack location.

### Count Down Counter (CTD)
The Count Down (CTD) instruction counts backward from the current value each time the Count Down (CD) input transitions from off to on. When the current value Cxx equals 0, the Cxx counter bit activates. The counter resets the Cxx counter bit to zero and loads the current value with the preset value PV when the Load (LD) input changes to on. The counter stops when it reaches zero, and the Cxx counter bit turns on.

**STL Operation:**
- Load Input: Top of the stack.
- Count Down Input: Value loaded in the second stack location.

### Count Up/Down Counter (CTUD)
The Count Up/Down (CTUD) instruction counts up each time the Count Up (CU) input transitions from off to on and counts down each time the Count Down (CD) input transitions from off to on. The current value Cxx of the counter maintains the current count. The preset value PV is compared with the current value each time the counter instruction is executed. When it reaches the maximum value (32,767), the next rising edge on the count input causes the current count to reset to the minimum value (-32,768). When it reaches the minimum value (-32,768), the next rising edge on the count input causes the current count to reset to the maximum value (32,767). If the current value Cxx is greater than or equal to the preset value PV, the Cxx counter bit turns on; otherwise, it turns off. The counter resets to zero when the Reset (R) input changes to on or when the Reset instruction is executed.

**STL Operation:**
- Reset Input: Top of the stack.
- Count Down Input: Value loaded in the second stack location.
- Count Up Input: Value loaded in the third stack location.

## Conclusion
I identified different types of counters that can be used for ladder programming in the Step7 MicroWin software, through the observation and research of their operation (CTU, CTD, CTUD), and their implementation in controlling a pneumatic circuit using a PLC (CTU, CTUD). In this way, I observed the operation of PNP sensors and implemented their use in executing the electro-pneumatic circuit control of a double-acting pneumatic cylinder with solenoid actuation and return, activated by the PLC.
