# Interlocking

## 1. Verify the operation of the start/stop circuit with priority stop.

**Simulation American Standard (ANSI) and European Standard (DIN)**

Use of the stop button after the start interlocking state has occurred (Without shift).

Selection of both buttons (Using manual interlocking / shift).
Priority to Start is observed.

## 2. Verify the operation of the start/stop circuit with priority start.

**Simulation American Standard (ANSI) and European Standard (DIN)**

Use of the stop button after the start interlocking state has occurred (without shift).

Selection of both buttons (Using manual interlocking / shift).
Priority to Start is observed.

## 3. Assemble and test the selector circuit with three buttons described in the theoretical class video.

**Simulation American Standard (ANSI)**

Selection of each of the interlocked buttons (Without using manual interlocking / shift).

Selection of all buttons simultaneously (Using manual interlocking / shift), and use of the general stop.

**Simulation European Standard (DIN)**

Selection of each of the interlocked buttons (Without using manual interlocking / shift).

Selection of all buttons simultaneously (Using manual interlocking / shift), and use of the general stop.

## CONCLUSION

I observed the different functions of the relay through the theoretical class presentations. In number 3, I performed and identified the different interlocking functions of the relay (with priority to stop or start), as well as its operation in the selector circuit. Through simulation in the Fluid Sim software and the practical implementation of the circuits.
