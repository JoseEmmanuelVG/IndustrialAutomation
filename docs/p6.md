## Memorized Connection Delay ("TONR") Timers

- 8 ("T1" to "T4" and "T65" to "T68") with a resolution of 10 ms
- 54 ("T5" to "T31" and "T69" to "T95") with a resolution of 100 ms

### Exercise No. 1: Bistable System - Start with Delay - SET with Delay

| Start (I0.1) | Stop (I0.2) | TON T38 (seconds) | Q0.0 |
|--------------|--------------|--------------------|------|
| 0            | 0            | 0                  | 0    |
| 1            | 0            | 0‚â§T38<50           | 0    |
| 1            | 0            | 50‚â§T38             | 1    |
| 1            | 1            | 0‚â§T38              | 0    |

The output coil activates when the timer T38 reaches 50 or more. When the stop button is pressed, regardless of the count, the output turns off.

The output coil activates when the timer reaches 50 or more. When the stop button is pressed, regardless of the count, the output turns off.

### Exercise No. 2: Monostable Circuit with One-Shot
The coil is energized once the start input has a pulse, at which time the timer starts counting, once the timer reaches its set time of actuation, it switches off the output coil. The timer is restarted when a pulse is given on the reset input, and if both inputs are active the output will be off.

**Version A: Manual Reset**
| Start (I0.1) | Stop (I0.2) | TON T39 (seconds) | Q0.0 |
|--------------|--------------|--------------------|------|
| 0            | 0            | 0                  | 0    |
| 1            | 0            | 0‚â§T38<30           | 1    |
| 1            | 0            | 30<T38             | 0    |
| 1            | 1            | 0‚â§T38              | 0    |

The coil activates once the start input receives a pulse. At that moment, the timer starts counting. Once the timer reaches its set activation time, it turns off the output coil. The timer resets when a pulse is given to the stop (reset) input. If both inputs are active, the output will be off.

**Version B: Automatic Reset**
The timer restarts automatically once the set time to turn off the output is reached, so if the start input is latched, the output coil will remain in a loop while the timer automatically restarts. Now, the stop must be latched if the start is on for the timer to restart, if only one pulse was given the timer restarts when the stop is pressed, regardless of the count.

### Exercise No. 3: Astable Circuit with One-Shot
The coil activates once the start input receives a pulse. At that moment, timer T38 starts counting. Once timer T38 reaches its set time (3s) for activation, the second timer T40 turns off the output for the set time (1s). When that time is over, T38 resets, and the cycle begins again. The timer resets when a pulse is given to the stop (reset) input, and if both inputs are active, priority is given to stop.

| 0            | 0            | 0                  | 0                  | 0    |

| 1            | 1            | T38=0              | T40=0              | 0    |

### Conclusion

Observe the behavior and characteristics of each of the timers available in the programming software. Create simulated and practical systems using the connection delay ("TON") timer, identifying different forms of activation and implementation that can be carried out using SET-RESET coils and internal marks.
