# Practice 7: Methodology for Working with Timers and Comparators

## TIMING DIAGRAM SEQUENCE
Using timers, SET-RESET coils, and internal marks, create a circuit that follows the timing diagram. Observe the difference between the use of timers and comparators.

### A2. Comparator Sequence

## TRAFFIC LIGHT SEQUENCE
Create the traffic light sequence shown in the following timing diagram:

### SIMULATION ladder program for PLC S7-200

## CONCLUSION

I observed different methods for developing a sequence system based on timing diagrams by applying timers and comparators. I identified their applications, main characteristics, and compared their ease and versatility of operation. The result is shorter and less repetitive programs when using comparators compared to using multiple timers to solve problems presented in the diagrams.
